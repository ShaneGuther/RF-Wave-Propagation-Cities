# RF-Wave-Propagation-Cities
A program to simulate RF wave propagation in a real world city setting.

The user can use the GUI to change the settings of the simulation, including the location in either downtown Toronto or London as well as the materials
in buildings and terrain in the model.  Longitude and latitude can be entered to change the location of the receiver to achieve different results.

Up to two models can be generated at once to view side-by-side figures like path loss and power loss.

Specific wave forms can be selected from within the siteviewer to view their isolated path/power loss.
